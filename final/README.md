WEB DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND METHODS (INFO 6250) FINAL PROJECT

Car Showroom Project.

Steps to Run the application: 
    * First run npm install(in both server & client folders).
    * Change the folder path to `\server`  (\final\server) folder and perform `npm run start` command. 
    * Check package.json `scripts` section for any different OS.

Goals: 
    * Firstly, an user needs to Sign up by providing username.
    * An user can add new car's details like car model name, car's information, any car image url(as per the example card provided) and submit these details.
    * We can see all this information related to the car on the top of the page.
    * We can add a comment to this car's information and/or edit and/or delete the car details.
    * Lastly, an user can log out.
    * Default Card(first car details) cannot be deleted or edited by any user. It can be done by admin only.
